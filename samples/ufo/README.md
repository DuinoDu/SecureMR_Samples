## Sample: UFO

This sample builds an application for PICO using the
SecureMR APIs. In the application, users become a 
pilot who remotely control a disc-shape UFO to chase
human beings whoever they see. By simply looking 
at other people's heads, the user will find their UFO
flies towards the detected human being and floats
above their head. 

The sample deploys an open-sourced face detection from
MediaPipeline via SecureMR, and renders a UFO of
glTF 2.0 format.

### Code walk-through

The sample loads the algorithm from `asset/ufo/facedetector_fp16_qnn229.bin`, which is
converted from Qualcomm's re-implementation of MediaPipe face detection. The UFO asset to be
rendered is the `asset/ufo/UFO.gltf`, loaded to the global tensor: `gltfAsset`. 

There are four pipelines in this sample: 

1. `m_secureMrVSTImagePipeline` to obtain the RGB images. Although we only use the left-eye 
    image for face detection, we still need the stereo-view RGB outputs (in global tensor
    `vstOutputLeftUint8Global` and `vstOutputLeftUint8Global` respectively), the image timestamp
    (`vstTimestampGlobal`) and the camera matrix `vstCameraMatrixGlobal` for the 2D-to-3D pipeline
    to compute an accurate 3D position. 
2. `m_secureMrModelInferencePipeline`, as the key pipeline, to run the face detection
    algorithm on the RGB image from the above pipeline, and outputs the 2D coordinate
    of the face center, in the global tensor: `uvGlobal`.
3. `m_secureMrMap2dTo3dPipeline` uses the on-device depth sensor, to project back the
    2D coordinate of the face center and obtain the 3D coordinate under OpenXR's 
    XR_LOCAL reference space. The result 3D coordinate is stored in `currentPositionGlobal`.
4. `m_secureMrRenderingPipeline` updates the world pose of the "UFO" according to the detected
    coordinate in `currentPositionGlobal`. The pipeline also incorporates a damping algorithm
    to smooth the trajectory of UFO and mimicking the physics. The damped coordinate is
    updated to `previousPositionGlobal` for usage in the next frame.
