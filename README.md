## Project aims

The projects demonstrates the functionalities and usage of
the SecureMR interfaces through several out-of-the-box
sample applications. The applications each achieve some
customized MR-based effects with deployment of open-sourced
machine learning algorithms. 

Additionally, the project provides a set of utility classes,
located under [`./base/securemr_utils`](base/securemr_utils/README.md)
to simplify your
development of SecureMR-enabled applications. 

A docker file together with necessary resources are also 
contained under the `Docker/` directory, if you would like
deploy your own algorithm packages.

## Prerequisite

#### (A) To run the demo, you will need

1. A PICO 4 Ultra device with the latest system update
1. Android Studio, with Android NDK installed, suggested NDK version = 25
1. Gradle and Android Gradle plugin (usually bundled with Android Studio install),
   suggested Gradle version = 8.7, Android Gradle Plugin version = 8.3.2
1. Java version at least 17 (required by the Android Gradle Plugin), recommended to be 21

#### (B) To run the docker, you will need

1. Docker desktop installed

## Deployment and Test

1. Install and configure according to the [prerequisite](#prerequisite). 
1. Open the repository root in Android Studio, as an Android project
1. After project sync, you will find there are four modules detected by the Android Studio, all under the `samples` folder: 
  1. `pose` which contains a pose detection demo
  1. `ufo` which contains a face detection demo
  1. `yolo` which contains an object detection demo
  1. `ufo-origin`, the same demo as `ufo`, but written using direct calls to the OpenXR C-API, with no 
      simplification using SecureMR Utils classes. 
1. Connect to a PICO 4 Ultra device with the latest OS update installed
1. Select the module you want to run, and click the launch button.
